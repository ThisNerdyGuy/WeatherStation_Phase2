WeatherStation_Phase2
=====================

This bit of code takes the functional code presented in Phase I and combines it with the code supplied by adafruit Industries for their data logging shield. 

I ran into issues where my TEMT6000 Ambient Light Sensor would only output a high value of 1023. I am still not entirely sure what was going on there. 

To fix it, I started over with the combining of the sensor code with the data log code. I had adafruit_support_bill scratching his head on the forum because everything looked correct. It was very peculiar. 

Nevertheless, this code is functional now; I have verified by compiling/uploading and logging the atmospheric conditions in my own home. 

Feel free to use this code as you see fit and ENJOY! But please share your code as well. The key to open source is keeping it open!
